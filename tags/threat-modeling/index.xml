      <description>Threat modeling underpins risk-based application security. What is threat modeling? According to TechTarget:
 Threat modeling is a procedure for optimizing network security by identifying objectives and vulnerabilities, and then defining countermeasures to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, threats to the system.
 That definition emphasizes network security. The concept applies to other kinds of security &amp;ndash; application, infrastructure, physical, etc.
Why does threat modeling matter? It grounds security in technical and business risk.</description>
